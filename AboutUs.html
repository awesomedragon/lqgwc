 <h2>Welcome to our stress relief website! This is no ordinary webpage lecturing you about stress; instead, we want to help you relieve it through the many features. We gathered tools scattered across the web and organized them for your use and convenience. As you explore our website, be sure to check out all the cool features. 
 <br> </br>This website was designed by 2016-2017 La Quintaâ€™s Girls Who Code as a way to reach out to the community through technology.  As we observed some concerns of our community, one that stood out most to us was the stress students gain through long hours of homework and tackling daily tasks of everyday life. </h2>
